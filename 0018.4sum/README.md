# [18. 4Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/)

## Title
Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c, and d in S such that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.
```
For example, given array S = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.

A solution set is:
[
   [-1, 0, 0, 1],
   [-2, -1, 1, 2],
   [-2, 0, 0, 2]
]
```
## Problem solving ideas
My idea of answering this question is the same as the idea of [15. 3Sum](./Algorithms/0015.3sum), which is just one more loop.

## to sum up
Unknown problems can be converted into known problems to solve.
